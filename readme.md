# Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮

This is an interactive **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The game allows the user to play against the computer, keeps track of **wins, losses, and draw matches**, and also provides a **New Game** button to reset the game anytime.

This project is my **first step into the Web Development domain**, helping me understand core JavaScript concepts and DOM manipulation.
